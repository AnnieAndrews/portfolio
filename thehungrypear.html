          <p>For the growing number of people that find themselves on a restrictive diet, it’s hard to find restaurants meant for you. Most of the apps that are available today only offer a vegetarian filter to search by which is a very broad scope and often misses the mark for many searchers. It leaves the possibility for a user to wind up at a restaurant where the only option for them is a simple salad. The Hungry Pear is an iOS app designed to help those individuals identify the exciting restaurant options for them in their area.</p>

                  <p>Eating a gluten free diet is on the rise; the number of people identifying as vegetarian or partially-vegetarian is steadily inclining; more and more we are paying attention to what we eat and the diet we consume. For some it’s from a medical diagnosis like an allergy or intolerance, for others it’s an ethical or moral or personal decision to refrain from certain foods, and for others they are seeking the diet that best suites them and their energy levels. Current restaurant search engines don’t cater to these specific groups. Image what that means then for those with more than 1 dietary restriction. And then there’s the all-too-common experience of getting a search result that really shouldn’t be a hit... I’ve been there - when you filter your search by vegetarian, get to the restaurant, and they have 1 option - a salad. The Hungry Pear is the solution to these tiring frustrations and this underserved market.

                  <p>The Hungry Pear app finds the real restaurants that these groups people can go to and have ample food options available and a dining experience that is catered to them. No matter where they go, they can search by their location and filter by their diet(s) and be able to read reviews, make reservations, and order the food that they want to eat. So it was important to create an easy, understandable search experience that would get the user all the information they need to know they are going to have a good dining experience.</p>

                    <h3>Get to know the user</h3>
                    <p>I needed to better understand the perspective user, but I decided to not limit the survey to only those with dietary restrictions. I opened it up to anyone because this should be an app that anyone really can use - even if they are just curious about a diet, curious about the app, or interested in trying new foods in one of these filters. So I created a user survey to learn, among other things, the following:</p>
                    <div class="questions">
                      <ul>
                        <li>If they identified with an diets or had food restrictions, if so which;</li>
                        <li>the most important things considered when choosing a restaurant to dine at;</li>
                        <li>which navigation apps most frequently used so to create an easy and familiar search experience;</li>
                        <li>The usual reasons they dine out; and</li>
                        <li>If they like to try new foods to determine demand for this type of product.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>The survey was distributed across social media and online forums and completed by nearly 40 respondents. Main takeaways from the responses:</p>
                    <div class="questions">
                      <ul>
                        <li>85% of respondents eat out more than once a week, identifying there is a market for this app.</li>
                        <li>Of the respondents 25% identified with at least one dietary restriction.</li>
                        <li>67% surveyed currently use an iOS phone, so this is what our prototype was built on.</li>
                        <li>A surprising 13% of respondents had a lactose intolerance.</li>
                        <li>The type of cuisine was most important when deciding where to eat.</li>
                        <li>72% of users use Google Maps over other navigation options, so we desired our experience to be familiar with this app for ease of use.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>After the survey I took a closer look at a few of the respondents that followed restricted diets. Here's a look into some of the prospective users:</p>

                      <h3>User Flows</h3>
                      <p>After learning more about users and the competition, I used user stories to help me prioritize product features to be included in The Hungry Pear’s MVP. Stories were then converted into user flows to describe and visualize the interaction of a user with the product.</p>

                      <h3>Branding</h3>
                      <p>When creating The Hungry Pear’s identity, it was also important that users understood the app revolved around food. The original name, The Good Map, was deemed too ambiguous after receiving feedback. After revisiting, the trigger word ‘hungry’ became the focal point of the name.</p>
                      <img src="images/thehungrypear/brainstorming.png"  alt="Brainstorming">
                      <p>It was also important that the text and images used didn’t exclude any individuals or alienate any groups. While this is a hard task to fill, I worked to research what foods are most common across all diets. Results revolved primarily around fruits and vegetables.</p>

                  <section class="design">
                      <h3>Design</h3>
                      <h5>Low fidelity wireframes</h5>
                      <p>Throughout the wireframing process, I was talking with users about what they would expect the app to do and how they'd prefer to interact within it. One of the main goals and identified priorities, was to have a search function similar to those that users are already interacting with.</p>
                      <img src="images/thehungrypear/lofi.png" alt="Low Fidelity Wireframes">
                      <h5>Refining</h5>
                      <p>As conversations and testing continued, there were a number of pieces to the app that were rehauled, one of these was the <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>. The starting idea featured a modal on top of the map. We wanted a way to give users a little more information about how to search on the app but this was later scrapped as it isn’t a standard iOS practice and not a familiar experience to users.
                        <br/>The second idea was to have a 3 screen introduction through use of pagination. The first screen featured an app introduction, the second gave directions, and the third started the user off on their search. This idea was also scrapped because as the entirety of the the app underwent building, the design resembled a very straight forward search function and through talking with potential users of the app, everyone was able to figure out how to use the app without getting directions.
                        <br/>We decided on a simple welcome screen, meant to appear for users either when they open the app as a new user or if they are a returning user who is not signed in. This way there is a colorful and inviting introduction to engage our users and excite them about their restaurant search, as  opposed just opening onto a simple map. The final design allowed us to feature colorful food photos and build brand recognition through the use of the logo and word mark.
                      </p>
                      <img src="images/thehungrypear/refine1.png" alt="Refining the Homescreen">
                      <p>Another piece of the app to undergo major changes was the <strong>SEARCH</strong> feature. In initial planning, this screen was going to allow a user to choose between a frequently searched diet or search using text search for a diet not listed. At least for the starting scope of The Hungry Pear, this was scaled back due to the large increase in resources it would take to allow for any diet to be searched on and yield quality search results. After reviewing surveys and conversations with potential users, the most common diets were selected. One of the diets, as previously touched on, was not expected. It was a shock to learn just how many surveyed individuals identified as lactose intolerance and it was, in fact, added into our list of options.
                        <br/>Then as we were creating the search page, we initially intended to use pills for the user to select. This idea was scrapped, however, to accomodate more imagery contributing to brand recognition and a positive, food focused experience with The Hungry Pear.
                      </p>
                      <img src="images/thehungrypear/refine2.png" alt="Refining the Search Feature">
                      <p>Along the way the <strong>NAVIGATION</strong> bar also saw a lot of adjustment. Initially, to build brand recognition, the idea of having the word mark always on the screen was favored. But as we brought brand recognition into the app in other ways, this was ultimately deemed confusing and unneccessary.<br/>
                          The icons also underwent changes. The profile picture was removed in place of a more standard account settings icon as we walked away from having formal profiles. Seeing as the app currently does not have a functionality for communication between users the profile was changed to a more simple account settings.<br/>
                          Another large change was the removal of the “home” button. Talking with users, it was confusing which screen they should go to search on the map because the home screen was the map, and the search screen was separate. This was resolved by bringing in a full screen modal to search right on the map screen, also being consistent with how users would expect to interact with a map on iOS. <br/>

                      <h5>Final Design &amp; Prototyping</h5>
                      <p>After figuring out the perfect experience I added the final, polished design to give the user an interface they enjoyed interacting with. Keeping with the brand’s identity the finished design features the color scheme and of course, dramatic, drool-worthy imagery to excite and entice.<br/><br/>

                  The Hungry Pear solves a real life problem for those eating within a restrictive diet. Reflecting on the research and design of the product, perhaps the most important lesson learned on the way was to be aware of personal biases. The concept of the application came from a personal struggle I’ve had, so making sure that I was talking to others and not relying on my own opinions for concept and design decisions was key.<br/>
                  In considering further development and deployment of The Hungry Pear, I would expect there to be a continuous feedback loop to allow the product to evolve and improve with its users. There is growth opportunity as the product expands into new locations and new diets. There is also the unique opportunity to incorporate with APIs for restaurant suggestions in the user’s location.
