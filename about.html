                <p class="info">
                  Like many midwesterners, I made the move to Colorado when the opportunity presented itself. I packed up the rental, my border collie puppy, and brought my small-town Wisconsin charm out to the mountains… and some Spotted Cow. Living in Denver, when I’m not hiking or camping you’ll probably find me teaching yoga at a studio around town or brunching it up at one of the many alluring options downtown.<br/><br/>
                  Throughout my life I’ve sought out creative expression. Writing and performing music, participating in theater, taking creative writing courses, drawing and painting. Even as a young girl I would arrange, rearrange, and re-rearrange my room constantly. I saw picking out my outfits as a form of expression and made elaborate songs in my head to the rhythms I’d hear in the world around me. But I hadn’t seen just how connected my life had been intertwined with this artistry.<br/><br/>
                  In college I decided to become an accounting major, vastly different than expected. I made the decision because - like many - I wasn’t sure exactly what I wanted to do post school. But I saw the great value in being able to speak the language of business. To be knowledgeable and educated in a field and type of communication that often frustrates, confuses, and unsettles individuals. My classically trained piano skills taught me the importance of detail that aided me in the accounting field, and after college I excelled in my public accounting career. But it was never quite right.<br/><br/>
                  Creativity energizes me. While my accounting experience was valuable and memorable, I’ve been shown just how important it is to be passionate about what you do. Because when you love it, you will have more energy to give to the communities around you and the clients you serve. So I bring with me my professional skills and a different perspective: how important it is to know the ‘why’s’ behind decision making, showing your process, keeping a keen eye for detail, working with your team, knowing how to ask questions, to always be inquisitive and curious, all while serving the others with good communication.<br/><br/>
                  My journey to a career in design may not have been straightforward but I am full steam ahead and ready to make my mark.
