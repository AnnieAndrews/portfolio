          <p>Solsquad is an e-commerce brand providing athletic and athleisure wear for the modern, stylish individual. The brand was developed to capture their edgy style and target their primary audience of young adults. I was tasked with designing a responsive website that represents their brand and serves their clients a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience.</p>

                  <p id="solution">In a hierarchical navigation, like most online shopping experiences are, it’s important that the user understands where in the site they are so they can easily browse exactly what they want. Integrating clear a progression through the site with a clean, and brand representative style across all viewing platforms was the real challenge.<br/><br/><br/>

                <label id="problem">The Solution</label>
                  <p id="solution">Providing a user-tested site that differentiates itself by being highly intuitive and simple while representing the brand and highlighting their market differentiation. Solsquad aims for a minimalist style to not take away from the focus of why the user is there - to shop and see what they are shopping for. The result is a functional app that requires little effort to “figure out” and leaves the user satisfied.

                    <h3>Get to know the user</h3>
                    <p>I needed to better understand the perspective user. To do this, I talked with contacts at local yoga studios, communities of people who practice yoga and purchase yoga clothing online, and I created a user survey to learn, among other things, the following:</p>
                    <div class="questions">
                      <ul>
                        <li>What they like and dislike about online shopping;</li>
                        <li>What athletic/athleisure products they usually shop for online;</li>
                        <li>How they decide what size to buy when shopping online;</li>
                        <li>What type of imagery inspires them;</li>
                        <li>They’re browsing habits.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>The survey was distributed across social media and online forums and completed by nearly 30 respondents. Main takeaways from the responses:</p>
                    <div class="questions">
                      <ul>
                        <li>Over 15% of respondents said they read reviews to decide what size to purchase (this affected the review modal);</li>
                        <li>Over 81% of respondents read reviews before purchasing an item. This made this an important feature to highlight and really make simple and clean;</li>
                        <li>The order of most important information when making a purchase online was so: price, sizes available, customer reviews, colors available.</li>
                        <li>45% responded that they occasionally checkout using PayPal. This made this an important feature to be included in the checkout process;</li>
                        <li>The main reason they would sign up for company e-mails and newsletters was because the company has good sales/discount information.</li>
                        <li>When browsing online, most respondents said they were looking either for a specific item (ie top, shorts, bra, etc) or to see what’s on sale. This effected our navigation bar.
                        <li>The demographic or respondents directly correlated to the company’s main market, that being 18-39 year olds (young adults).</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>An analysis of market competitors Alo Yoga, Lululemon, Werkshop, Teeki, and others found that Solsquad’s experience should incorporate simplicity in display similar to Alo Yoga, and carry more brand personality similar to Teeki in the way products are presented through imagery. Werkshop’s website contained a very prominent feature, being able to shop the brand’s Instagram feed on the website. This will be incorporated since much advertising is done now through this free platform that reaches a such vast audience daily.

                            <p>Staying true to the Solsquad modern and edgy look, I wanted the presentation of the brand through the wordmark and logo to be representative of this. The name Solsquad was derived from a brainstorming activity building lists of words representative of growth, light, and community. In regards to the icon, the logo was removed to favor of developing brand recognition through the types and styles of images used across the site, typically darker contrast, edgier, with a more ‘unposed’ feeling.<br/>

                          <p>The focal point of the website is to make it as easy as possible for users to accomplish their goals. Arriving to the website, most everyone wants to get to browsing. By watching and talking to users, we observed their browsing habits and where they usually click or go to right away. Through iterations we were able to find the most enjoyable and understandable navigation layout and concept for Solsquad shoppers.<br/>

                          <p>Reviews are an important piece of selling the Solsquad products, and in order to have reviews there has to be an easy way for customers to submit them. Originally when a user selected to ‘add a review’ for a product, they were brought to a new screen to complete the review form. Upon talking to users this was replaced with a modal to keep users interested in the process for longer instead of being deterred by waiting for a new screen to load.<br/>

            <label>Conclusion</label>
              <p>The strengths of Solsquad are in its intuitive and simple design, accomplishing it’s goal to give users an easy browse and purchase experience. Through user testing and design iterations, an easy to navigate interface was developed.<br/>
                  User testing provided crucial information through the process, helping me to check my own personal biases and design with confidence. Be able to watch users browse and observe their habits helped capture the little nuances that people weren’t able to provided simply by talking. For further development of the website I would focus on presenting clear imagery, not too small or too large, and continuously talk to users about how they are feeling while engaging with the site.<br/>
                  We were validated by receiving positive responses to Solsquad. Words like “clean” and “understandable” confirmed that users’ experience was positive.
