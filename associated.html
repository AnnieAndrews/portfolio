                  <p>Possibly the most popular, new athletic and athleisure brand in the world. This young company founded in Denver attracts hundreds of new clients from around the world everyday to their design innovation. They are entirely online in the ecommerce market so it is especially important to given users an easy to understand experience. I was asked to design a responsive website that represents their brand and serves their clients. This included an eCommerce solution to convert traffic from their successful Instagram following to their website to sell their products to this growing platform. I partnered with the Solsquad team to uncover insights and translate this into a seamless user experience. From start to finish, I served the company everything from brand development and definition, to user-testing and research, to wireframing, to user interface design.<br/><br/>The inspiration for Solsquad comes from my own personal desire to have more high-quality brands of athleisure wear that offer a differentiated look - not just mainstream and what you would expect in athletic clothing.

                    <h3>Get to know the user</h3>
                    <p>I needed to better understand the perspective user. To do this, I talked with contacts at local yoga studios, communities of people who practice yoga and purchase yoga clothing online, and I created a user survey to learn, among other things, the following:</p>
                    <div class="questions">
                      <ul>
                        <li>What they like and dislike about online shopping;</li>
                        <li>What athletic/athleisure products they usually shop for online;</li>
                        <li>How they decide what size to buy when shopping online;</li>
                        <li>What type of imagery inspires them;</li>
                        <li>They’re browsing habits.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>The survey was distributed across social media and online forums and completed by nearly 30 respondents. Main takeaways from the responses:</p>
                    <div class="questions">
                      <ul>
                        <li>Over 15% of respondents said they read reviews to decide what size to purchase (this affected the review modal);</li>
                        <li>Over 81% of respondents read reviews before purchasing an item. This made this an important feature to highlight and really make simple and clean;</li>
                        <li>The order of most important information when making a purchase online was so: price, sizes available, customer reviews, colors available.</li>
                        <li>45% responded that they occasionally checkout using PayPal. This made this an important feature to be included in the checkout process;</li>
                        <li>The main reason they would sign up for company e-mails and newsletters was because the company has good sales/discount information.</li>
                        <li>When browsing online, most respondents said they were looking either for a specific item (ie top, shorts, bra, etc) or to see what’s on sale. This effected our navigation bar.
                        <li>The demographic or respondents directly correlated to the company’s main market, that being 18-39 year olds (young adults).</li>
                      </ul>
